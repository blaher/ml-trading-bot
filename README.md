A Machine Learning trading bot test

This bot is not profitable. It was a test that allowed me to be able to grab a mass amount of stock data, analyze it, and create algorithms that predicted very well. It's failure was in its trading mechnics that the algorithms I made could not profit on. Since I abanoned this code base, I have decided to release it. I did however use this entire concept, along with the generated models, to carry over in my currently working bot. Which will remain unpublished to the public. Hopefully those looking in to this will find it useful in their own projects.
